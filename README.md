# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The movitivation behind the Prework study guide is to really try to push myself to learn something new. The problem it does solve is the ability to follow things through and not give up even if things don't make sense now. I built this project because I am so interested in the world of coding and the abilities it gives you to not only help each other but also give the world tools and this is the first stepping stone to that goal. I also learned that coding isn't something that you can just study for and have the ability to code. That is only 10% of it. The rest is actually applying yourself to code and learn from your mistakes and learn new ways to code.

## Usage

The purpose of this webpage is to have something to go to and continue to add notes to if at some point you forget something. I also added a hyperlink to the 'CSS' section because it has a very valuable piece of information on making things interactive. Also if need be and don't know where to start and study for maybe an upcoming test. If you go to the devtools section and refresh the page it will give you a randomized selection on what to study first.
